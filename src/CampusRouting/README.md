Demo: Esri Campus Routing
=======================
Required version: ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET 200.5.0

This cross-platform sample demonstrates offline* indoor geocoding and routing for a campus.

The app uses .NET MAUI to allow running the app on any Windows 10 Device, Android, iOS and Catalyst, and also provides some simple unit testing for running both with the Visual Studio MS test runner and on a device using MSTestX.

You can also quickly tweak the code to offer a 3D view of the campus* which better visualizes floor changes.

* Note: The 3D version requires an online connection. In addition, while the 2D Map works offline, the app must be online on the first run to provision the data from ArcGIS Online.
