This sample demonstrates the following ArcGIS Runtime features:

* AR Toolkit support for Xamarin.Forms
* Convenience property for rendering detected planes
* Tabletop AR (the scene is pinned to a detected surface)
* Render and animate 3D models - the demo shows an airplane circling Melbourne, Australia
* Dynamic viewshed analysis - visualize what is hidden and what is obscured for a passenger in the airplane.
