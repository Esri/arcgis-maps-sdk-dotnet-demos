# Simple Portal Browser

Sample app that shows a simple ArcGIS Portal Browser using the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/) with MAUI, UWP, and WPF. The app uses MVVM patterns and shares the most of the logic between all platforms through a shared project, but uses individual views tailored for the experience on the specific device.
