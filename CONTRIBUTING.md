# Contribution guidelines

Esri welcomes contributions to this project in the form of issues. We do not currently accept new PRs for full features, for example an entire new demo app or a significant change to an existing demo app. We encourage you to submit issues for:

- Bugs you find while using the demos.
- Requests for new demo apps or enhancements to existing demo apps.

For all other contributions (example: minor bug fixes), see Esri's [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).
