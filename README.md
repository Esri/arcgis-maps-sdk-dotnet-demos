# ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET Demos

This project contains source code for simple native .NET applications that demonstrate common workflows for utilizing and displaying spatial information.
You can also find a set of smaller feature-focused samples in the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for .NET Samples](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-dotnet) repo.

### Demos

* [`Symbol Editor`](src/SymbolEditor) - A WPF .NET Core app (and MSIX installer project) that shows using mobile styles, and creating/editing vector symbol layers. 
* [`Turn-by-Turn Routing`](src/TurnByTurn) - A turn-by-turn app that shows routing and navigation on WPF, UWP, and MAUI.
* [`MAUI Portal Sign In`](src/MauiSignIn) - Demonstrates using OAuth to sign into an ArcGIS Portal, retrieve and save an ArcGIS Maps SDK license, and store credentials persisting across application sessions.
* [`Using an External GPS Device`](src/ExternalNmeaGPS) - A Windows Desktop app showing how to use data from an external GPS or NMEA log file to power the MapView's LocationDisplay.
* [`Esri Campus Routing`](src/CampusRouting) - A cross-platform (Xamarin) sample demonstrating indoor geocoding and routing for a campus running on Windows Universal, Android and iOS.
* [`Electronic Navigation Charts (ENC)`](src/HydrographicsSample) - Demonstrates how to work with and render ENC data using the Hydrographics package.
* [`GeoEvent Server Streaming Service`](src/GeoEventServerSample) - Demonstrates how to stream data from ArcGIS GeoEvent Server and render them on the map.
* [`Geocode & Route on MouseMove`](src/GeocodeAndRoutingOnMouseMove) - Demonstrates fast reverse geocoding and routing during mouse-move on Windows Desktop (WPF) and Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
* [`Viewshed analysis in tabletop AR with Xamarin.Forms`](src/ViewshedInTabletopAR) - Demonstrates how to do a viewshed analysis in a tabletop AR scenario using a moving graphic with Xamarin.Forms.
* [`Offline workflows`](src/OfflineWorkflowsSample) - Demonstrates how to browse a portal for offline-enabled maps and take them offline. Also demonstrates how to open maps previously taken offline.
* [`KML Viewer`](src/KmlViewer) - A UWP app for visualizing KML/KMZ files in 2D and 3D.
* [`Editing geometries in a SceneView`](src/SceneViewEdit) - A Windows Desktop app demonstrating how to do geometry editing in 3D using a customer editor.
* [`Measure Tool`](src/MeasureTool) - A simple sample demonstrating how to use the editor to create your own measure tool.
